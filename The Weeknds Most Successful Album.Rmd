The purpose of this project is to analyze which albums from The Weeknd were the most successful in terms of the rankings of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The Billboard Hot 100 chart is the standard ranking chart for top songs that are based on sales, radioplay, and streaming (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100). The hot 100 dataset was obtained from Sean Miller from dataworld (Source: https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017)
